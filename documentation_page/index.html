            <p>C++ is a general-purpose programming language and widely used nowadays for competitive programming. It has imperative,
            object-oriented and generic programming features. C++ runs on lots of platform like Windows, Linux, Unix, Mac etc.</p>
            <p>C++ is an efficient and powerful language and finds wide use in various GUI platforms, 3D graphics and real-time
            simulations. Because of the inclusion of rich function libraries, working in C++ becomes simpler and convenient than C.
            Being object-oriented programming like Java, C++ provides the support of inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, etc.
            Unlike C, C++ allows exception handling and function overloading. Bringing in the important topics under one roof, this
            tutorial to C++ is a very efficient and convenient way to learn C++ from scratch.</p>
            <p>To begin with let’s lay the foundation by knowing how and why C++ as a programming language is so important and what
            uses it finds in the field of computer science and programming.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Information on the C++ language
                These articles briefly describe the features of this programming language:
                A brief description<br>
                Some general aspects of this language.
            </li>
            <li>History of C++:<br>
            Brief history of the development of this language.
            </li>
            <li>Frequently Asked Questions:
            A short list of common questions novice programmers ask.

            <p>Learning C++ programming can be simplified into writing your program in a text editor and saving it with correct
            extension(.CPP, .C, .CP) and compiling your program using a compiler or online IDE. The “Hello World” program is the
            first step towards learning any programming language and also one of the simplest programs you will learn.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Platform-independent - C++ is platform-dependent. Java is platform-independent.</li>
                    <li>Mainly used for -  C++ is mainly used for system programming. Java is mainly used for application programming. It is widely
                    used in Windows-based, web-based, enterprise, and mobile applications.</li>
                    <li>Design Goal - C++ was designed for systems and applications programming. It was an extension of the C programming
                    language. Java was designed and created as an interpreter for printing systems but later extended as a support network
                    computing. It was designed to be easy to use and accessible to a broader audience.</li>
                    <li>
                        Goto -  C++ supports the goto statement. Java doesn't support the goto statement.
                    </li>
                    <li>Multiple inheritance - C++ supports multiple inheritance. Java doesn't support multiple inheritance through class. It can
                    be achieved by using interfaces in java.</li>
                    <li>Call by Value and Call by reference - C++ supports both call by value and call by reference. Java supports call by value
                        only. There is no call by reference in java.</li>
                    <li>Object-oriented - C++ is an object-oriented language. However, in the C language, a single root hierarchy is not possible.
                    Java is also an object-oriented language. However, everything (except fundamental types) is an object in Java. It is a
                    single root hierarchy as everything gets derived from java.lang.Object.</li>

                    <li>In the program, the variable “global” is declared at the top of the program outside all of the functions so it is a

                    Loops in programming come into use when we need to repeatedly execute a block of statements. For example: Suppose we
                    want to print “Hello World” 10 times. This can be done in two ways as shown below:

                    A function declaration tells the compiler about a function name and how to call the function. ... Function declaration
                    is required when you define a function in one source file and you call that function in another file. In such case, you
                    should declare the function at the top of the file calling the function.
